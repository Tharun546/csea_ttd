          <p>The Transportation Department of Telangana is set up for enforcement of the provisions of the Motor Vehicle Act, 1988 and Telangana Motor Vehicles Taxation Act, 1963 and the rules under it.
               Though Telangana has a good rail and air transport system, yet road transport is the most important one.
                It helps the people especially in rural areas to travel from one place to another with much ease.
            The Transport Department of Telangana is controlled by the Transport Commissioner who is the Head of the Transport Department and is helped by an Additional Commissioner and four Joint Commissioners, three Regional Transport Officers and one Regional Transport officer

                <p>The districts of Telangana are well connected by rail route that run all across the state.
                    It not only has a well developed inter-state but also intra-state rail route.

                <p> Since the state was earlier part of Andhra Pradesh, the major cities of Telangana are already connected with the important cities of India.

                <p>Transportation is an important facet for the development of any place. While the transportation facilities in Telangana as far as road transport is concerned,
                     is being taken care of by Telangana State Road Transport Corporation buses as well as APSRTC (Andhra Pradesh State Road Transport Corporation) buses,
                     air transport needs a careful revamping in the days to come. The government has come up with new and innovative plans which will connect Telangana with neighbouring states and places abroad in a much better way.<br>
                    </p>
            <p class="content__text">
             <p>   Going by what the aviation experts proclaim, since it is not feasible to have more large airports in Telangana too soon,
                  it might be a good idea to look forward for a small airport every few hundred kilometres which seems possible and is a public requirement too. 
                 This would improve connectivity and aid in investment and development even in remote areas of this newly formed state.  
            International airports require minimum of 9,000 metres of runway. There are around 16 airstrips in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana - some functional while others redundant.
