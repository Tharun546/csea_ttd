                <p class="lead">Chowmahalla Palace is among the most remarkable palaces of the Nizams in Hyderabad that has preserved its original
                beauty. Also known as ‘Chowmahallat Palace’, it's derived from two Urdu words-chār mahallāt, meaning 'four palaces.'
                In March 2010, it was declared as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It's spread across 12 acres of courtyards, gardens,
                palaces, and fountains.
                
                While Salabat Jung began its' construction in 1750, it was completed by Asaf Jah V in 1869; hence, the exotic interiors
                and architecture reflect the era of the Asaf Jahi Dynasty. It was recognized as a prime seat in that era and was the
                formal residence of the Nizams of Hyderabad during their rule. Now under Barkat Ali Khan Mukarram Jah, heir of the
                Nizams, it's one of the best tourist spots in the city.</p>

                <p class="lead">Telangana state is home to many religious sites, which also includes ancient Buddhist settlements. Buddhism is an
                ancient religion that flourished right from thousands of years. There are many significant Buddhist sites in Telangana
                of great heritage importance. The region close to Nagarjuna Sagar dam, located in the Nalgonda district of Telangana is
                home to one of the oldest Buddhist civilizations in India.
                Here, many historic artefacts were discovered during the process of building the mighty dam here in the 1950s.
                Nandikonda is a village located close to Nagarjuna Sagar dam, and it was once part of the Ikshvaku Dynasty. The region
                gained prominence after the discovery of many Buddhist structures like pillared halls and monasteries. The Buddhist
                Heritage Museum was inaugurated officially on May 14th 2014, to mark the Buddha Jayanthi celebrations.

                <p class="lead">Ramappa Temple, also known as the Rudreshwara temple, is a UNESCO World Heritage Site located in Telangana, India. It is
                15 km (9.3 mi) from Mulugu, 66 km (41 mi) from Warangal, 209 km (130 mi) from Hyderabad. An inscription in the temple
                says it was constructed in the year 1213 CE by Recharla Rudra—a General of Kakatiya ruler Ganapati Deva
                1199–1262.[1][2][3] Located in the vicinity of Ramappa Lake, the Ramappa Temple complex which consist of three temples
                was constructed between 1212 and 1234, designed and architect by Ramappa—after whom the temple complex is named.[4]
                
                The temple is a Sivalayam, where Lord Ramalingeswara is worshipped. Marco Polo, during his visit to the Kakatiya empire,
                allegedly called the temple "the brightest star in the galaxy of temples".[5] Ramappa Temple stands majestically on a
                6-foot (1.8 m) high star-shaped platform. The hall in front of the sanctum has numerous carved pillars that have been
                positioned to create an effect that combines light and space wonderfully. The temple is named after the sculptor
                Ramappa, who built it, and is perhaps the only temple in India to be named after its craftsman.[5]</p>
